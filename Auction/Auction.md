### Problem: Optimal Auction Design for Revenue Maximization with Real-Valued Allocations

#### Scenario:
You are an auctioneer tasked with designing an auction to sell a divisible good (e.g., a certain amount of bandwidth or a share of a resource). There are \( n \) bidders, each with a private valuation \( v_i \) for the good. The goal is to design an auction mechanism that maximizes the auctioneer's expected revenue while ensuring that the auction is incentive-compatible (bidders are motivated to bid their true valuations) and individually rational (bidders do not end up with negative utility).

#### Variables:
- \( v_i \): Valuation of bidder \( i \)
- \( b_i \): Bid of bidder \( i \)
- \( p_i \): Payment made by bidder \( i \)
- \( x_i \): Allocation variable (amount of the good allocated to bidder \( i \), can be any real value between 0 and 1)

#### Objective:
Maximize the expected revenue:
\[ \text{Maximize} \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \]

#### Constraints:
1. Incentive Compatibility: Each bidder maximizes their utility by bidding their true valuation.
   \[ u_i(v_i) = v_i x_i - p_i \geq v_i x_i' - p_i' \quad \forall i \]
   where \( x_i' \) and \( p_i' \) are the allocation and payment if bidder \( i \) bids \( v_i' \) instead of \( v_i \).

2. Individual Rationality: Each bidder's utility is non-negative.
   \[ u_i(v_i) = v_i x_i - p_i \geq 0 \quad \forall i \]

3. Allocation Constraint: The total allocation cannot exceed the available amount of the good.
   \[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \leq 1 \]

4. Non-Negative Payments: Payments must be non-negative.
   \[ p_i \geq 0 \quad \forall i \]

#### Solution Approach:
This problem can be solved using iterative optimization methods such as Newton's method. The key is to formulate the Lagrangian for the constrained optimization problem and iteratively update the variables to find the optimal solution.
